h1. Eigen Magma benchmark
 
This project provides a simple benchmarking facility for Eigen. It was developed mainly for benchmarking the Eigen MAGMA backend implementation. This project also serves as sample CMake project to use Eigen in combination with MAGMA and MKL. 

h2. Requirements

You need to first install Intel MKL, Eigen, CUDA and MAGMA. It has been tested with Intel Parallel Studio 2013, Eigen 3.2.0, CUDA 5.5 and MAGMA 1.4.0-beta2. 

h2. Modus Operandis

* Clone the Eigen-Magma project: https://github.com/bravegag/eigen-magma
* Clone this project: https://github.com/bravegag/eigen-magma-benchmark
* Export the following variables
<pre><code>export EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=<location where you cloned eigen-magma>
export MAGMA_ROOT=<your magma install location>
</code></pre> 

* Create a Release build with the following command (using Intel compiler):
<pre><code>rm -rf build; mkdir build; cd build; cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpc -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort ../src
</code></pre> 

* Edit the CMakeLists.txt file and enable Eigen only, MKL or MAGMA by commenting or uncommenting the following definitions:
<pre><code>add_definitions(-DEIGEN_USE_MKL_ALL)
add_definitions(-DEIGEN_USE_MAGMA_ALL)
</code></pre>  

* Build the project executing <code>make</code> to have faster compilation with more threads e.g. 5 use <code>make -j5</code>

* Execute the benchmark <code>./benchmark</code> or use <code>./benchmark --help</code> for help. 

h2. Results

The following plots where obtained by executing the currently ported Eigen MAGMA backends:

The benchmarks above where obtained using <code>export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1</code> and <code>export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1</code> increasing the <code>MKL_NUM_THREADS</code> may improve the results for both the MKL and the MAGMA versions. Furthermore, unlike the benchmarks shown in MAGMA testing implementations these benchmark results above account for the memory transfer times from Host to Device. This is the reason why the dgemv and dtrsm do not seem to perform better than the CPU versions.
